        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices unsmoked back bacon</li>
            <li>2 free-range medium eggs</li>
            <li>1tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2 bagels</li>
            <li>Ketchup</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop your bagels into your toaster. If you can only fit one bagel in at a time, consider grilling them so that both bagels are nice and warm by the time the dish is served.</li>
            <li>Oil your pan and set it on a low heat. Add your bacon to the pan and flip every 45 seconds-minute.</li>
            <li>After adding the bacon, go ahead and crack your eggs into the pan also. Perhaps stack your bacon slices in order to avoid the eggs overspilling into the bacon slices. Wait approximately 2 minutes to cook your eggs fully.</li>
            <li>Once the bacon has started to crisp up and brown in certain areas, remove it from the pan and onto the toasted bagels.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are fully cooked, use a spatula to remove them from the pan and onto your bagels.</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, and pop a dollop of ketchup onto each egg to give a sweeter taste to these savoury snacks. And finally, don't forget to enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
